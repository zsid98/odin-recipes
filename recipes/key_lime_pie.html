        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This key lime pie recipe is made with condensed milk and sour cream.</p> 
        <p>Fabulously easy and a summertime favorite! If you have time, a homemade graham cracker crust is better. Garnish with whipped cream 
            and thin slices of lime if you like.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>¾ cup key lime juice</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated lime zest</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine condensed milk, key lime juice, sour cream, and lime zest in a bowl; mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour into graham cracker crust; place pie on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 8 minutes, until tiny pinhole bubbles burst on the surface of the pie. 
                The filling will be wobbly but not browned.</li>
            <li>Transfer pie to a wire rack to cool, then thoroughly chill pie in the refrigerator before serving, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Garnish with lime slices and whipped cream, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
